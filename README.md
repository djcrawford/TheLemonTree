Hello Sam,
  Just look through the issues tab for a list of things that need to be done in the project. Let me know if you have any issues.
  
 Phase 1
 Make a Console Application to demonstrate the desired functionality. The App should be able to:
 1. Insert a Vehicle
 2. Remove a Vehicle
 3. View All Vehicles
 
 Phase 2
 Add database support for the Console App
 
 Phase 3
 Add an web front end to the application
